# This client script receives newly-built files from the server script
# and (1) writes them out to the Buffer and (2) feeds them to the chopper.
# When the chopper has run to completion, it touches the file filereceived
# on the Buffer to advance the server.  There is a client log that records
# the output of the Chopper as well as statements when files are complete.
# The client also writes a joblog file for each builder file at
# $RUN.chopper.log to record the job numbers associated to that file.

# This script is designed for use with the L2 Master Script.  It can be run
# independently by giving it the arguments listed below:
